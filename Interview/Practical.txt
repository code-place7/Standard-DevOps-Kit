# DEVOPS / AUTOMATION INTERVIEW PREPARATION NOTES

# =====================================================

##############################

## ROUND 1 – AUTOMATION

##############################

1- Write a Python script that counts the number of .txt files in the current working directory.

## [1] Python Script – Count .txt files

import os

count = 0
for file in os.listdir('.'):
if file.endswith('.txt'):
count += 1

print(f"Total .txt files: {count}")

✔ IMPRESSION LINE:
This script is clean, efficient, and easily extendable to recursive searches or filters.

---

2- Write a playbook that installs Nginx and ensures the service is started and enabled at boot.

## [2] Ansible Playbook – Install & Start Nginx

* name: Install and start Nginx
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:

  * name: Install nginx
    apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
    update_cache: yes

  * name: Ensure nginx is running and enabled
    service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: yes

✔ IMPRESSION LINE:
This playbook is idempotent and ensures service reliability at boot.

---

3 - Bash backup script that creates a compressed backup of a directory with a timestamp.

## [3] Bash Backup Script

#!/bin/bash
SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/source"
BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/backup"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
BACKUP_FILE="$BACKUP_DIR/backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"

mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

tar -czf "$BACKUP_FILE" "$SOURCE_DIR"

echo "Backup completed: $BACKUP_FILE"

✔ IMPRESSION LINE:
Ensures timestamped, compressed, and safe backups.

##############################

## ROUND 2 – LINUX & SYSTEMS

##############################

1 - Explain the difference between hard link and soft link.
## [1] Hard Link vs Soft Link

Hard Link  : Same inode, cannot cross filesystem, survives deletion
Soft Link  : Shortcut path, can cross filesystem, breaks if original removed

“A hard link points to the same inode and survives deletion of the original file, while a soft link is just a pointer to the file path and breaks if the original file is removed.”

2 - How would you check which ports are listening on a server?
## [2] Check Listening Ports

ss -tulnp

# or

netstat -tulnp

“I use the ss -tulnp command to list all listening ports along with the processes using them, which helps in quick network troubleshooting.”


3 - How would you check disk usage for all mounted partitions?
## [3] Disk Usage

df -h

du -sh *

4 - Explain how to find and kill a process
## [4] Find & Kill Process

ps aux | grep <process>
kill -9 <PID>

Example----- ps aux | grep nginx or better--- pgrep nginx
Graceful Kill --- kill <PID>
Force Kill ---- kill -9 <PID>

🐳 If it is a Docker container

Then you should use Docker commands:
docker ps
docker stop <container_id>
docker kill <container_id>

“I first identify the process using ps or top, analyze resource usage, and then terminate it gracefully using kill. I only use force kill (-9) when the process is unresponsive.”




5 - What is grep, awk, and sed?
## [5] grep vs awk vs sed

grep : search text
awk  : column & pattern processing
sed  : stream editing

6 - How do you manage permissions in Linux?
## [6] File Permissions

chmod 755 file
chown user:group file

Permission Values:
read(4) write(2) execute(1)

“I use the ss -tulnp command to list all listening ports along with the processes using them, which helps in quick network troubleshooting.”

7 - How would you troubleshoot a server running slowly?
## [7] Troubleshooting Slow Server

STEP 1 → CPU  : top / htop
STEP 2 → RAM  : free -m
STEP 3 → DISK : iostat / iotop
STEP 4 → NET  : iftop
STEP 5 → LOGS : /var/log

✔ IMPRESSION LINE:
I always troubleshoot systematically across CPU, memory, disk, network, and logs.
“I follow a structured approach by checking CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network usage using tools like top, free, iostat, and iftop, and then verify logs to identify the root cause.”

##############################

## ROUND 3 – DEVOPS / CLOUD

##############################

1 - How do you create a new branch and switch to it?
## [1] Create & Switch Git Branch

git checkout -b feature-branch
“I create and switch to a new branch using git checkout -b branch_name so I can work on features independently without affecting the main codebase.”

2 - Explain how you would handle failed builds in Jenkins.
## [2] Handling Failed Jenkins Build

1. Check console logs
2. Identify failed stage
3. Verify dependencies
4. Fix issue
5. Re-run pipeline
“I review the console output, identify the failed stage, verify dependencies or configuration issues, fix the problem, and then re-run the pipeline.”

3 - How do you create a new Jenkins job for building a project?
## [3] Create Jenkins Job

1. New Item
2. Choose Job Type
3. Add Git repo
4. Configure build steps
5. Save & Build
“I create a new job, configure the source repository, define build steps, and then run the job to automate the build process.”

4 - How do you remove unused Docker images and containers?
## [4] Remove Unused Docker Resources

docker system prune -a

5 - How do you list all running Docker containers?
## [5] List Running Containers

docker ps

6 - How do you expose a Pod using a Service?
## [6] Expose Pod via Service

kubectl expose pod mypod --type=NodePort --port=80
“I expose a pod using a Kubernetes Service such as NodePort or ClusterIP to make the application accessible within or outside the cluster.”

7 - How do you stop, start, and terminate an EC2 instance? What happens to data on instance store vs EBS?
## [7] EC2 Lifecycle + Storage
You can do it using AWS CLI (this is what interviewers expect when they ask “how”)
Start      → Boots instance
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0

Stop       → Keeps EBS, stops compute
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0

Terminate  → Deletes instance
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0


Storage:
Instance Store → Lost on stop/terminate
EBS            → Persistent
“EBS volumes are persistent storage, while instance store is ephemeral. I always ensure critical data is on EBS or backed up to S3 before stopping or terminating instances.”

8 - How do you enable HTTPS on an AWS Load Balancer?
## [8] Enable HTTPS on Load Balancer

1. Create SSL certificate (ACM)
2. Attach to ALB (port 443)
3. Configure target group

9 - You need to move an EC2 instance from one subnet to another. How would you do it?
## [9] Move EC2 to Another Subnet

1. Stop instance
2. Create AMI
3. Launch new instance in target subnet

10 - What is the difference between Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB)?
## [10] ALB vs NLB

ALB → Layer 7, HTTP/HTTPS, path-based routing
NLB → Layer 4, TCP/UDP, ultra low latency

=====================================================
FINAL HR IMPACT LINE
====================

I focus on automation, scalability, and reliability. I design solutions that are efficient, repeatable, and production-ready.
