DEVOPS INTERVIEW – MY STORY (FRESHER VERSION)
============================================

Interviewer: Question
Me: My Answer (explained in simple, fresher-friendly language)

--------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION & FUNDAMENTALS
--------------------------------------------------

Interviewer: Introduce yourself
Me: I am a fresher DevOps engineer who has learned AWS, Linux, Git, Docker, Jenkins, and basic Kubernetes. I have worked on hands-on projects where I deployed applications on AWS, automated builds, and learned how real DevOps environments work. I am eager to learn, improve, and grow in a DevOps role.

Interviewer: What is Cloud Computing?
Me: Cloud computing means using servers, storage, databases, and networking over the internet instead of buying physical hardware. We pay only for what we use, and we can scale resources anytime.

Interviewer: What is AWS and which services have you used?
Me: AWS is a cloud platform provided by Amazon. I have used EC2 for servers, S3 for storage, IAM for access control, VPC for networking, Load Balancer, Auto Scaling, CloudWatch, and RDS in my practice projects.

Interviewer: Explain your projects
Me: I worked on a project where I deployed a 3-tier web application on AWS. I used EC2 for servers, Nginx as a web server, Auto Scaling for high availability, and Github Actions for CI/CD. The main goal was automation and reliability.

--------------------------------------------------
AWS CORE SERVICES
--------------------------------------------------

Interviewer: Explain EC2, AMI, IAM, and S3
Me: EC2 is a virtual machine in AWS. AMI is a template used to create EC2 instances. IAM is used to manage users, roles, and permissions securely. S3 is object storage used to store files, backups, and static content.

Interviewer: What is Auto Scaling and Load Balancer?
Me: Auto Scaling increases or decreases EC2 instances based on traffic. Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances so that no single server is overloaded.

Interviewer: What is Disaster Recovery?
Me: Disaster Recovery means having a backup and recovery plan in case of failure. It includes backups, snapshots, and sometimes using multiple regions to avoid downtime.

Interviewer: What is 3-Tier Architecture?
Me: It has three layers: presentation layer (frontend), application layer (backend), and database layer. It improves security, scalability, and maintenance.

Interviewer: Difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
Me: HTTP is not secure. HTTPS encrypts data using SSL/TLS, making communication secure.

Interviewer: How do you configure HTTPS?
Me: We use an SSL certificate (ACM in AWS) and attach it to a Load Balancer or web server, then redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

--------------------------------------------------
AWS NETWORKING
--------------------------------------------------

Interviewer: What is VPC?
Me: VPC is a private network in AWS where we launch our resources.

Interviewer: Public vs Private Subnet
Me: Public subnet has internet access. Private subnet does not allow direct internet access.

Interviewer: Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway
Me: Internet Gateway allows public instances to access the internet. NAT Gateway allows private instances to access the internet securely.

Interviewer: Why do private subnet instances need IPs?
Me: They need private IPs for internal communication and for outbound internet access through NAT.

Interviewer: Security Group vs NACL
Me: Security Group works at instance level and is stateful. NACL works at subnet level and is stateless.

Interviewer: How to block an IP in VPC?
Me: We can block an IP using NACL rules or Security Group rules.

Interviewer: What is VPC Peering?
Me: VPC Peering connects two VPCs privately so they can communicate securely.

--------------------------------------------------
LINUX
--------------------------------------------------

Interviewer: Basic Linux commands
Me: ls, cd, pwd, cp, mv, rm, chmod, chown, top, df, free

Interviewer: How do you rename a file?
Me: Using mv oldname newname

Interviewer: Explain useradd command
Me: useradd creates a new user. Example: useradd devops

Interviewer: vmstat and netstat
Me: vmstat shows CPU and memory usage. netstat shows network connections and ports.

--------------------------------------------------
WEB SERVER
--------------------------------------------------

Interviewer: What is Nginx?
Me: Nginx is a web server and reverse proxy used for high-performance applications.

Interviewer: Nginx root path
Me: Usually /var/www/html or /usr/share/nginx/html

Interviewer: Explain an Nginx project
Me: I used Nginx as a reverse proxy for applications running in Docker containers.

--------------------------------------------------
DEVOPS & CI/CD
--------------------------------------------------

Interviewer: What is DevOps?
Me: DevOps is a culture that improves collaboration between development and operations teams.

Interviewer: Tools used in DevOps
Me: Git, GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS

Interviewer: CI vs CD
Me: CI is continuous integration. CD can be continuous delivery or continuous deployment.

Interviewer: Explain CI/CD flow
Me: Code commit → Jenkins build → Test → Docker image → Deployment.

--------------------------------------------------
GIT & GITHUB
--------------------------------------------------

Interviewer: What is Git and GitHub?
Me: Git is a version control tool. GitHub is a platform to store Git repositories.

Interviewer: What happens when you run git init?
Me: It creates a new Git repository.

Interviewer: How do you push code to GitHub?
Me: git add . → git commit → git push

Interviewer: How to undo commits?
Me: Using git reset or git revert.

Interviewer: Set Git username and email
Me: git config --global user.name and user.email

--------------------------------------------------
JENKINS
--------------------------------------------------

Interviewer: What is Jenkins?
Me: Jenkins is a CI/CD automation tool.

Interviewer: What is Jenkinsfile?
Me: Jenkinsfile defines pipeline stages as code.

Interviewer: How Jenkins pulls code from GitHub?
Me: Using Git webhooks or polling.

--------------------------------------------------
DOCKER
--------------------------------------------------

Interviewer: What is Docker?
Me: Docker is a container platform to package applications.

Interviewer: What is Dockerfile?
Me: Dockerfile has instructions to build Docker images.

Interviewer: Build and run Docker image
Me: docker build and docker run

Interviewer: Container vs VM
Me: Containers share OS, VMs have full OS.

--------------------------------------------------
KUBERNETES
--------------------------------------------------

Interviewer: What is Kubernetes?
Me: Kubernetes manages and orchestrates containers.

Interviewer: Why Kubernetes when Docker exists?
Me: Docker runs containers, Kubernetes manages scaling, healing, and networking.
