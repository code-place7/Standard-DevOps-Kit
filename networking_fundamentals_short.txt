NETWORKING FUNDAMENTALS — THE SHORT & SIMPLE STORY


Only the ideas that truly matter — explained in the easiest way possible.

----------------------------------------
1. IP ADDRESS — HOW THINGS FIND EACH OTHER
----------------------------------------

Every device on the internet needs an address.
That address is called an IP address.

Think of it like a house address.
Without it, no data knows where to go.

Public IP → reachable from the internet  
Private IP → used only inside a private network

----------------------------------------
2. DNS — NAMES FOR HUMANS
----------------------------------------

Humans hate remembering numbers.
Computers don’t.

DNS connects the two.

You type: travelbody.com  
DNS finds: the IP address

It’s like saving phone numbers as contacts.

----------------------------------------
3. PORTS — MULTIPLE APPS, ONE SERVER
----------------------------------------

One server can run many applications.
So how does traffic reach the correct one?

Ports.

IP = building address  
Port = door number

Examples:
- Website → 80 / 443
- Database → 3306

----------------------------------------
4. SUBNETS — SEPARATION FOR SAFETY
----------------------------------------

Putting everything together is dangerous.

So we split the network into subnets:
- Public subnet → things users access
- Private subnet → databases, backend

This limits damage if something is attacked.

----------------------------------------
5. ROUTING — MOVING DATA BETWEEN SUBNETS
----------------------------------------

Subnets don’t talk automatically.

Routing decides:
“How does data go from here to there?”

It’s like GPS for network traffic.

----------------------------------------
6. FIREWALLS — WHO IS ALLOWED IN?
----------------------------------------

Just because traffic *can* reach something
doesn’t mean it *should*.

Firewalls are security guards:
- Allow only specific ports
- Allow only specific sources

Everything else is blocked.

----------------------------------------
7. NAT — PRIVATE SERVERS NEED INTERNET TOO
----------------------------------------

Private servers cannot be reached from the internet.
But they still need to access it.

NAT solves this.

Many private servers share ONE public IP.
They stay hidden but still go online.

----------------------------------------
8. CLOUD DOES NOT CHANGE THE RULES
----------------------------------------

In the cloud:
- VPC = your private network
- Subnets = same idea
- Firewalls = same idea
- NAT = same idea

Only the tools change.
The concepts stay the same.

----------------------------------------
9. CONTAINERS — SAME APP EVERYWHERE
----------------------------------------

Containers package:
- Code
- Libraries
- Settings

So the app runs the same on every machine.

Containers still use:
- IPs
- Ports
- Networks

----------------------------------------
10. KUBERNETES — MANAGING AT SCALE
----------------------------------------

Kubernetes manages containers automatically.

Key ideas:
- Pod → smallest unit, gets an IP
- Pods change and die often
- Service → stable IP & name
- Ingress → entry point from internet

Apps talk to Services, not Pods.

----------------------------------------
FINAL TAKEAWAY (MOST IMPORTANT)
----------------------------------------

If you remember ONLY this:

- IP = identity
- DNS = name lookup
- Port = correct door
- Subnet = separation
- Routing = path
- Firewall = rules
- NAT = safe internet access

These ideas power:
- Servers
- Cloud
- Docker
- Kubernetes

Master these fundamentals,
and modern systems stop feeling confusing.
