DEVOPS REAL-WORLD PROJECT INTERVIEW NOTES
Project: Starbucks Application Deployment (Docker → AWS EKS with CI/CD, DevSecOps & Monitoring)

====================================================
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW (What did you do?)
====================================================
I worked on a real-world DevOps project where I deployed a Node.js application (Starbucks clone) using a complete CI/CD and cloud-native architecture.

Initially, the application was deployed as a single Docker container.
Later, I redesigned the deployment using AWS EKS (Kubernetes) to make the application scalable, highly available, secure, and production-ready.

The project included:
- AWS infrastructure setup
- Jenkins CI/CD pipelines
- Docker image build & push
- Code quality & security scanning
- Kubernetes deployment on EKS
- Monitoring using Prometheus & Grafana
- Domain & SSL using Cloudflare

====================================================
2. ARCHITECTURE & TOOLS USED
====================================================
Cloud Provider: AWS
CI/CD: Jenkins
Containerization: Docker
Orchestration: Kubernetes (AWS EKS)
IaC: Terraform
Security & Quality: SonarQube, Trivy
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
Source Control: GitHub
Domain & SSL: Cloudflare

====================================================
3. WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS PROJECT
====================================================
- After creating any computing instance in the cloud , always configure its Security Groups SO you can open Only necessary PORTS so you can access them    in the browser. 
- Why single-container deployments are not suitable for real users
- How Kubernetes provides auto-scaling, self-healing, and rolling updates
- How Jenkins integrates multiple tools & Plugins  in a CI/CD pipeline (
         ECLIPSE 
         NODE.jS
         PIPELINE:STAGE VIEW
         DOCKER 
         DOCKER API
         DOCKER-BUILD-STEP
         DOCKER PIPELINE
         DOCKER COMMON 
         SONARCUBE SCANNER )

- Importance of automation using shell scripts(
    Instead of manually installing ------
         AWS CLI
         Terraform
         Jenkins
         Trivy
         Sonarcube
         DOcker
         eksctl
         kubectl
         Prometheus(Blackbox_exporter)
         Grafana)
 
- How IAM permissions directly impact AWS operations
- How DevSecOps works in real pipelines (not theory)
- How Infrastructure as Code improves consistency and repeatability
- How monitoring completes a production-grade system

====================================================
4. CI/CD PIPELINE EXPLANATION
====================================================
Pipeline stages included:
- Workspace cleanup
- GitHub checkout using credentials
- SonarQube code quality analysis
- Quality gate enforcement
- Dependency installation
- Trivy file system scan
- Docker image build & push
- Trivy image scan
- Deployment to AWS EKS using kubectl
- Email notifications with scan reports

This ensured code quality, security, and automated deployment.

====================================================
5. WHY MOVED FROM DOCKER TO EKS
====================================================
Problems with single Docker container:
- No auto-scaling
- Single point of failure
- High cost when running 24/7
- Manual recovery on failure

Benefits of EKS:
- Horizontal pod scaling
- High availability
- Rolling updates with zero downtime
- Load balancing
- Cost optimization

====================================================
6. MONITORING SETUP
====================================================
- Used Terraform to provision monitoring infrastructure
- Installed Prometheus to collect metrics
- Installed Grafana for visualization
- Exposed required ports via Security Groups
- Ensured visibility into system health and performance

====================================================
7. CHALLENGES I FACED
====================================================
⚠️ Challenges I faced (and what they taught me)

-Security group misconfigurations
Forgetting to open required ports (9000, 9090, 9115, 3000) broke access — taught me to think networking-first when launching any EC2.

-Jenkins user vs Ubuntu user AWS credentials
Pipeline failed until I configured AWS CLI for the Jenkins user — learned how Linux users and permissions directly impact automation.

-SonarQube integration complexity
Tokens, webhooks, tool names, and URLs had to match exactly — small mismatches break CI quality gates.

-EKS IAM & OIDC issues
Missing IAM policies and OIDC provider caused deployment failures — reinforced how critical IAM is in Kubernetes.

-Pipeline evolution challenges
Refactoring pipelines from Docker-only deployment to EKS deployment required careful stage removal and plugin changes.

-Monitoring setup mistakes
Blackbox Exporter failed initially due to missing security group rules — monitoring infrastructure needs the same rigor as apps.

-Understanding cost vs availability trade-offs
Running containers 24/7 on EC2 isn’t scalable — Kubernetes helps balance availability and cloud cost.

====================================================
8. HOW I SOLVED THE CHALLENGES
====================================================
- Debugged AWS permissions step-by-step
- Verified AWS identity using aws sts get-caller-identity
- Used kubectl and logs for Kubernetes debugging
- Referred official documentation
- Broke problems into smaller tasks
- Automated repetitive tasks with scripts

====================================================
9. WHAT THIS PROJECT TAUGHT ME THAT HELPS A COMPANY
====================================================
- How to build scalable and fault-tolerant systems
- How to automate deployments end-to-end
- How to integrate security early in CI/CD
- How to reduce manual errors using IaC
- How to monitor systems proactively
- How to think like a production DevOps engineer

====================================================
10. FINAL INTERVIEW STATEMENT
====================================================
This project helped me understand how real-world DevOps works.
I learned how to design systems that are scalable, secure, automated, and cost-effective.
I can confidently explain CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes deployments, cloud infrastructure, and monitoring in a production context.
