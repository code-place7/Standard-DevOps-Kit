Git Workflows Explained — Notes to My Future DevOps Self

Hey future me 👋  
If you’re reading this, remember why you saved it: Git workflows are not about Git.
They’re about deployment speed, risk, automation, and team maturity — aka DevOps fundamentals.

This  broke down how Git workflows evolved and why high-performing DevOps teams
gravitate toward trunk-based development.

Let me explain this clearly, from a DevOps mindset.

--------------------------------------------------
WHY GIT WORKFLOWS MATTER (DEVOPS VIEW)
--------------------------------------------------

What is it?
Git workflows are agreed rules for how teams use branches, merge code, and deploy safely.

Where is it used?
- In all team-based software development
- Especially important in CI/CD and production deployments

When should it be used?
- Always in team environments
- When deployments affect real users
- When you want predictable and safe releases

--------------------------------------------------
GITFLOW — STRUCTURED WORKFLOW
--------------------------------------------------

What is it?
A Git workflow with multiple long-lived branches:
- main (production)
- develop (integration)
- feature, release, hotfix branches

Where is it used?
- Mobile applications
- Desktop software
- Enterprise software
- Regulated industries
-Where you have to installed the software before used on your machine

When should it be used?
- When software is released in versions
- When multiple versions must be supported
- When deployments are slow and controlled

DevOps perspective:
❌ Too slow for modern CI/CD  
❌ Heavy branch management  
❌ Poor fit for continuous deployment


--------------------------------------------------
GITHUB FLOW — SIMPLE WORKFLOW
--------------------------------------------------

What is it?
A lightweight workflow where `main` is always deployable.

Where is it used?
- SaaS products
- APIs
- Web applications
- Cloud-native systems

When should it be used?
- When there is only one production version
- When deployments happen frequently
- When CI/CD pipelines are reliable

DevOps perspective:
✔ Fast releases  
✔ Minimal branching  
⚠ Requires discipline and strong testing


--------------------------------------------------
TRUNK-BASED DEVELOPMENT (TBD) ---- NOWADAYS STANDARD APPROACH
--------------------------------------------------

What is it?
A workflow where developers commit directly to `main`
or use very short-lived branches.

Where is it used?
- High-performing DevOps teams
- Large-scale SaaS platforms
- Continuous deployment environments

When should it be used?
- When automated testing is very very very strong
- When CI/CD is mature
- When fast feedback is critical

DevOps perspective:
✔ Best support for CI/CD  
✔ Minimal merge conflicts  
✔ Fast recovery from failures


--------------------------------------------------
TBD REQUIREMENTS (IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------------------------

What is required?
- Automated tests
- CI pipelines
- Feature flags
- Safety guardrails

Where does it fail?
- Teams with weak tests
- Manual deployments
- Low automation maturity

When NOT to use it?
- If production safety depends on manual checks
- If CI/CD is unreliable

DevOps truth:
Trunk-based development forces you to build
the automation you should already have.


--------------------------------------------------
WHY WORKFLOWS EVOLVED
--------------------------------------------------

2010:
- Manual deployments
- Rare releases
- Weak automation
→ Gitflow made sense

Now:
- CI/CD everywhere
- Feature flags
- Cloud infrastructure
- Automation tools
→ Gitflow is too slow

Evolution path:
Gitflow → GitHub Flow → Trunk-Based Development

DevOps exists because:
Many teams are still stuck in 2010 practices.

--------------------------------------------------
HYBRID APPROACHES (REAL WORLD)
--------------------------------------------------

Most teams don’t follow textbook rules.

Examples:
- TBD + release branches
- Core team commits to main
- External teams use PRs
- Extra guard rails for safety

Lesson:
Workflows are tools, not religion.

Adapt based on:
- Team maturity
- Risk tolerance
- Test coverage
- Deployment frequency


--------------------------------------------------
FINAL MESSAGE TO FUTURE ME
--------------------------------------------------

Aim for trunk-based development.
But earn it.

If TBD feels scary:
- Your tests aren’t ready
- Your automation is weak
- Your feedback loops are slow

DevOps is about:
Speed of feedback > process complexity

Simpler workflows.
Faster learning.
Safer deployments.
